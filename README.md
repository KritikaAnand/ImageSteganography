# ImageSteganography

This Python project focuses on image steganography, a technique of hiding secret information within an image. 
The primary goal is to encode textual or binary data into an image without visibly altering its appearance. Conversely, the project allows for the extraction of hidden information from encoded images.The project also allows for the extraction of hidden information from encoded images. To enhance security, a password is required to encode messages, and users can decorate the message by entering a code.

## Features
-Encode text or binary data into images
- Password protection for encoded messages
- Message decoration with user-entered code
- Extraction of hidden information from encoded images

## Technologies used
- This Python project uses OpenCV for image processing and employs technography to seamlessly encode text or binary data within images. It ensures security through password protection for message encoding and allows users to enhance messages with a specific code. The technology stack includes Python and OpenCV.
